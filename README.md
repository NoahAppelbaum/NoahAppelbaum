## Hi, I'm Noah


### About
I'm a full-stack software engineer. I'm big on community, collaboration, and being productively nosey. 

Before transitioning to full-time software development, I spent many years as a performing artist and arts educator. Some creative career highlights include motion capture for Mortal Kombat, swordfighting at The Lyric Opera in Chicago, and shooting t-shirts out of a cannon at Chicago Bulls games. 

I currently build and maintain websites for several small businesses and non-profits, and volunteer with [Chi Hack Night](https://github.com/chihacknight).
